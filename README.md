A pidgey calculator for 3 pokemon

10/01/2017:
  Just uploaded a working(mostly) prototype in C.
  I have another version in C# (Console).
  I will likey move onto developing a GUI based version, allowing users to choose more pokemon and change certain parameters like the evolution time etc.
  I May try a web version although, I'm not that experienced in JavaScript.
  If I ever wanted to move towards a web version this would be ideal. Much like the existing Pidgey Calculator from Bai Chan Kheo @ https://www.pidgeycalc.com/
  My code was based on multiple sources as well as my own ideas.
  Feel free to have a look, might be a bit messy due to the comments and Psuedo code.
  
  Happy Coding
  Liam
